We propose a new Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulation of the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP), with which we overcame the best formulation of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) in terms of the minimum number of necessary variables. Furthermore, we present a detailed study of the constraints used and compare our model (GPS) with other frequent formulations (MTZ and native formulation). Finally, we will test whether the formulation is correct by entering it into a QUBO problem solver. The solver chosen is a D-Wave_2000Q6 quantum computer simulator due to the relationship between Quantum Annealing and QUBO formulations.
